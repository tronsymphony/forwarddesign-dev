                        The secret to organic social is the same as it's always
                        been: give value to your followers.

                        It’s such a well-known secret that it’s not really a
                        secret any more. To gain traction on social media, you
                        must create valuable and original content. But it’s not
                        just about value – consistency of output is key, as is
                        regularity. You’ll attract followers, increase
                        engagement and have better conversations with your
                        audience if you publish great quality content with
                        structure, and clear, concise message. And that’s where
                        one of the most valuable tools in social media
                        management comes in: the content plan.

                        At the very start of any social media campaign, our
                        Social Account Managers work to understand a brand’s key
                        audiences and demographics. Sometimes this overlaps with
                        your product’s audience research, for example, if
                        redeveloping your website at the same time. More often
                        than not, however, your social audience will differ to
                        your other market demographics, so a tailored approach
                        is required.

                      <p className="p1">
                        There are subtle nuances to each platform, and
                        understanding these details is the key to success. New
                        emergents appear with increasing regularity too – TikTok
                        has seen an explosion of adoption in the latter half of
                        2019, with a specific and clear 18-28 year old
                        demographic, ripping market share from Facebook. Our
                        team works with brands to identify their key audiences,
                        and how to find them.

                        If understanding where your audience resides is the
                        first half of the puzzle, then working out how to target
                        them is the second piece. And this is where we stress,

                        Our approach to content and social media marketing
                      </h2>
                      <p className="p1">
                        We often find our clients need help understanding social
                        media marketing, especially when it comes to the
                        content. Planning a content strategy can be a daunting
                        prospect, especially when trying to corral various
                        stakeholders, marketeers, product and brand teams. But
                        when done right, the content plan has the ability to not
                        only unify the communications coming out of your team,
                        but to drive better collaboration as a result. To tackle
                        the content process, we employ two specific techniques:
                      </p>
                      <h5 className="p1">
                        <b>Be open, transparent and collaborative</b>
                      </h5>
                      <p className="p1">
                        The content planning process must always start within an
                        audit of your brands current output and ambassadors, and
                        this must be as collaborative and inclusive as possible.
                        Social is often the very bleeding edge of company
                        communications – it’s the trenches when it comes to
                        engaging with your brand’s audience. The collaborative
                        approach often highlights hidden ideas, content and
                        feedback that would otherwise be missed or even excluded
                        from the plan.
                      </p>
                      <p className="p1">
                        But transparency doesn’t just happen at the start of a
                        campaign – the content planning process is an ongoing
                        monthly, weekly or sometimes even daily process. Which
                        means the action of soliciting team feedback and
                        collaboration is an ongoing thing. We regularly ask our
                        social media clients to project their content plan onto
                        the wall of the office, onto the company intranet or
                        somewhere it can be seen by everyone, throughout the
                        day. The benefit here is profound – we find it unifies
                        entire teams with the communications the company is
                        putting out and allows the team to understand the social
                        feedback in real time.
                      </p>
                      <p className="p1">
                        Transparency isn’t just internal too; content social
                        media marketing provides a unique opportunity to allow
                        your audience under the skin of your brand. You can
                        highlight your people, show the love, blood sweat and
                        tears you’ve put into crafting your product and use it
                        as a channel to address problems when they arise. The
                        simple fact is that social is often a warts-and-all kind
                        of deal, but the best campaigns that have driven some of
                        the highest engagement for our clients have been those
                        that have treated their audience with the utmost honesty
                        and openness, and invited them in to the
                        behind-the-scenes of their brand.

                        <b>Use cornerstone content to structure the plan</b>

                      <p className="p1">
                        The importance of cornerstone content in building out a
                        content plan can’t be understated – it’s the foundations
                        upon which the plan is built. Cornerstone content takes
                        many forms, but it can be generally described as the
                        thematic ‘grouping’ of content in line with your brand’s
                        operational or business strategy.
                      </p>
                      <p className="p1">
                        This might take the form of a new product announcement,
                        an initiative on reducing waste, a new partnership or a
                        public speaking engagement your business is part of.
                        Whatever it is, our team works to understand how these
                        will land in the schedule when they can be announced.
                        These might be monthly or quarterly, but for companies
                        taking a more agile approach, may be as quick to iterate
                        as bi-weekly.

                        organic content strategy.

                      <p className="p1">
                        All too often, social media agencies advise clients and
                        brands to publish as much content as possible,
                        regardless of the format. We believe this approach is
                        wrong, instead focussing on producing great quality
                        content in the formats that work best for each platform.
                        Doing this allows us to build a highly engaged
